# Self_driving_car_using_ML_and_OPENCV
Project Participants : Rakshith Vishwanatha , Pavan Gurudath and Aditya T

The following project serves as the basis for our WIPRO summer internship.

Processor: 
-----------------------------------
TI-OMAP 


Description: 
-----------------------------------
The project focuses on utilizing the accessories of the TI-OMAP along with few peripherals like
Camera,Stepper motor etc to implement a self-driving car based on Machine Learning achieved through 
either Neural Networks ,Genetic Algorithms or Logistic Regression.
